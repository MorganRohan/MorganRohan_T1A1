#ACME Corporation are hiring a new junior developer, as part of their hiring criteria they've created a "coding skill score" based on the specific competencies they require for this role; the more important the skill is for ACME corp, the more points it contributes to the "coding skill score" 
# The skills are weighted as follows:
# - Python (1)
# - Ruby (2)
# - Bash (4)
# - Git (8)
# - HTML (16)
# - TDD (32)
# - CSS (64)
# - JavaScript (128)
# â€‹
# Write a program that allows a user to input their skills and then tells them 
# a) Their overall "coding skill score" 
# b) Skills they may want to learn, and how much each one would improve their score
